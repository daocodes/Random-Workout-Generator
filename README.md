# Random-Workout-Generator
A Python-based workout generator that creates custom routines by pulling live exercise data from the WGER API. Just type in the muscle groups you want to train (e.g. “arms”, “legs”, “core”) and the program returns randomized exercises with set/rep suggestions and optional exercise descriptions.
